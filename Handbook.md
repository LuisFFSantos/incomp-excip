## 4 Empirical Formula and Molecular Weight

Acacia is a complex, loose aggregate of sugars and hemicelluloses with a molecular weight of approximately 240 000-580 000. The aggregate consists essentially of an arabic acid nucleus to which are connected calcium, magnesium, and potassium along with the sugars arabinose, galactose, and rhamnose.

## 5 Structural Formula

See Section 4.

## 6 Functional Category

Emulsifying agent; stabilizing agent; suspending agent; tablet binder; viscosity-increasing agent.

## 7 Applications in Pharmaceutical Formulation or Technology

Acacia is mainly used in oral and topical pharmaceutical formulations as a suspending and emulsifying agent, often in combination with tragacanth. It is also used in the preparation of pastilles and lozenges, and as a tablet binder, although if used incautiously it can produce tablets with a prolonged disintegration time. Acacia has also been evaluated as a bioadhesive; (1) and has been used in novel tablet formulations, (2) and modified release tablets. (3) See Table I.

Acacia is also used in cosmetics, confectionery, food products, and spray-dried flavors. (4)

- (a) Powdered acacia.
- (b) Spray-dried acacia.

## 10 Typical Properties

Acidity/alkalinity pH = 4.5-5.0 (5% w/v aqueous solution) Acid value 2.5

Hygroscopicity At relative humidities of 25-65%, the equilibrium moisture content of powdered acacia at 25 C is 8-13% w/w, but 8 at relative humidities above about 70% it absorbs substantial amounts of water.

NIR spectra see Figure 1.

Solubility Soluble 1 in 20 of glycerin, 1 in 20 of propylene glycol, 1 in 2.7 of water; practically insoluble in ethanol (95%). In water, acacia dissolves very slowly, although almost completely after two hours, in twice the mass of water leaving only a very small residue of powder. The solution is colorless or yellowish, viscous, adhesive, and translucent. Spray-dried acacia dissolves more rapidly, in about 20 minutes.

Specific gravity 1.35-1.49

Viscosity (dynamic) 100mPas (100cP) for a 30% w/v aqueous solution at 20 C. 8 The viscosity of aqueous acacia solutions varies depending upon the source of the material, processing, storage conditions, pH, and the presence of salts. Viscosity increases slowly up to about 25% w/v concentration and exhibits Newtonian behavior. Above this concentration, viscosity increases rapidly (non-Newtonian rheology). Increasing temperature or prolonged heating of solutions results in a decrease of viscosity owing to depolymerization or particle agglomeration. See also Section 12.

## 11 Stability and Storage Conditions

Aqueous solutions are subject to bacterial or enzymatic degradation but may be preserved by initially boiling the solution for a short time to inactivate any enzymes present; microwave irradiation can also be used. (5) Aqueous solutions may also be preserved by the addition of an antimicrobial preservative such as 0.1% w/v benzoic acid, 0.1% w/v sodium benzoate, or a mixture of 0.17% w/v methylparaben and 0.03% propylparaben. Powdered acacia should be stored in an airtight container in a cool, dry place.

## 12 Incompatibilities

Acacia is incompatible with a number of substances including amidopyrine, apomorphine, cresol, ethanol (95%), ferric salts, morphine, phenol, physostigmine, tannins, thymol, and vanillin.

An oxidizing enzyme present in acacia may affect preparations containing easily oxidizable substances. However, the enzyme may be inactivated by heating at 100 C for a short time; 8 see Section 11.

Many salts reduce the viscosity of aqueous acacia solutions, while trivalent salts may initiate coagulation. Aqueous solutions carry a negative charge and will form coacervates with gelatin and other substances. In the preparation of emulsions, solutions of acacia are incompatible with soaps.

## 13 Method of Manufacture

Acacia is the dried gummy exudate obtained from the stems and branches of Acacia senegal (Linne ') Willdenow or other related species of Acacia (Fam. Leguminosae) that grow mainly in the Sudan and Senegal regions of Africa.

The bark of the tree is incised and the exudate allowed to dry on the bark. The dried exudate is then collected, processed to remove bark, sand, and other particulate matter, and graded. Various acacia grades differing in particle size and other physical properties are thus obtained. A spray-dried powder is also commercially available.

## 14 Safety

Acacia is used in cosmetics, foods, and oral and topical pharmaceutical formulations. Although it is generally regarded as an essentially nontoxic material, there have been a limited number of reports of hypersensitivity to acacia after inhalation or ingestion. (6,7) Severe anaphylactic reactions have occurred following the parenteral administration of acacia and it is now no longer used for this purpose. (6)

The WHO has not set an acceptable daily intake for acacia as a food additive because the levels necessary to achieve a desired effect were not considered to represent a hazard to health. (8)

LD50 (hamster, oral): &gt; 18g/kg (9)

LD50 (mouse, oral): &gt; 16g/kg

- LD50 (rabbit, oral): 8.0 g/kg
- LD50 (rat, oral): &gt; 16g/kg

## 15 Handling Precautions

Observe normal precautions appropriate to the circumstances and quantity of material handled. Acacia can be irritant to the eyes and skin and upon inhalation. Gloves, eye protection, and a dust respirator are recommended.

## 16 Regulatory Status

GRAS listed. Accepted for use in Europe as a food additive. Included in the FDA Inactive Ingredients Database (oral preparations and buccal or sublingual tablets). Included in the Canadian List of Acceptable Non-medicinal Ingredients. Included in nonparenteral medicines licensed in the UK.

## 17 Related Substances

Ceratonia; guar gum; tragacanth.

## 18 Comments

Concentrated aqueous solutions are used to prepare pastilles since on drying they form solid rubbery or glasslike masses depending upon the concentration used. Foreign policy changes and politically unstable conditions in Sudan, which is the principal supplier of acacia, has created a need to find a suitable replacement. (10) Poloxamer 188 (12-15% w/w) can be used to make an oil/water emulsion with similar rheological characteristics to acacia. Other natural by-products of foods can also be used. (11) Acacia is also used in the food industry as an emulsifier, stabilizer, and thickener. A specification for acacia is contained in the Food Chemicals Codex (FCC). (12)

The EINECS number for acacia is 232-519-5.

## 11 Stability and Storage Conditions

Acesulfame potassium possesses good stability. In the bulk form it shows no sign of decomposition at ambient temperature over many years. In aqueous solutions (pH 3.0-3.5 at 20 C) no reduction in 8 sweetness was observed over a period of approximately 2 years. Stability at elevated temperatures is good, although some decomposition was noted following storage at 40 C for several months. 8 Sterilization and pasteurization do not affect the taste of acesulfame potassium. (7)

The bulk material should be stored in a well-closed container in a cool, dry place and protected from light.

## 12 Incompatibilities

-

## 13 Method of Manufacture

Acesulfame potassium is synthesized from acetoacetic acid tert -butyl ester and fluorosulfonyl isocyanate. The resulting compound is transformed to fluorosulfonyl acetoacetic acid amide, which is then cyclized in the presence of potassium hydroxide to form the oxathiazinone dioxide ring system. Because of the strong acidity of this compound, the potassium salt is produced directly. (8)

An alternative synthesis route for acesulfame potassium starts with the reaction between diketene and amidosulfonic acid. In the presence of dehydrating agents, and after neutralization with potassium hydroxide, acesulfame potassium is formed.

## 14 Safety

Acesulfame potassium is widely used in beverages, cosmetics, foods, and pharmaceutical formulations, and is generally regarded as a relatively nontoxic and nonirritant material. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that acesulfame potassium is not metabolized and is rapidly excreted unchanged in the urine. Long-term feeding studies in rats and dogs showed no evidence to suggest acesulfame potassium is mutagenic or carcinogenic. (9)

The WHO has set an acceptable daily intake for acesulfame potassium of up to 15mg/kg body-weight. (9) The Scientific Committee for Foods of the European Union has set a daily intake value of up to 9 mg/kg of body-weight. (3)

LD50 (rat, IP): 2.2 g/kg (7)

LD50 (rat, oral): 6.9-8.0 g/kg

## 15 Handling Precautions

Observe normal precautions appropriate to the circumstances and quantity of material handled. Eye protection, gloves, and a dust mask are recommended.

## 16 Regulatory Status

Included in the FDA Inactive Ingredients Database for oral and sublingual preparations. Included in the Canadian List of Acceptable Non-medicinal Ingredients. Accepted for use in Europe as a food additive. It is also accepted for use in certain food products in the USA and several countries in Central and South America, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Australia.

## 17 Related Substances

Alitame.

## 18 Comments

The perceived intensity of sweeteners relative to sucrose depends upon their concentration, temperature of tasting, and pH, and on the flavor and texture of the product concerned.

Intense sweetening agents will not replace the bulk, textural, or preservative characteristics of sugar, if sugar is removed from a formulation.

Synergistic effects for combinations of sweeteners have been reported, e.g. acesulfame potassium with aspartame or sodium cyclamate; see also Aspartame. A ternary combination of sweeteners that includes acesulfame potassium and sodium saccharin has a greater decrease in sweetness upon repeated tasting than other combinations. (10)

Note that free acesulfame acid is not suitable for use as a sweetener.

A specification for acesulfame potassium is contained in the Food Chemicals Codex (FCC). (11)

## 11 Stability and Storage Conditions

Acetic acid should be stored in an airtight container in a cool, dry place.

## 12 Incompatibilities

Acetic acid reacts with alkaline substances.

## 13 Method of Manufacture

Acetic acid is usually made by one of three routes: acetaldehyde oxidation, involving direct air or oxygen oxidation of liquid acetaldehyde in the presence of manganese acetate, cobalt acetate, or copper acetate; liquid-phase oxidation of butane or naphtha; methanol carbonylation using a variety of techniques.

## 14 Safety

Acetic acid is widely used in pharmaceutical applications primarily to adjust the pH of formulations and is thus generally regarded as relatively nontoxic and nonirritant. However, glacial acetic acid or solutions containing over 50% w/w acetic acid in water or organic solvents are considered corrosive and can cause damage to skin, eyes, nose, and mouth. If swallowed glacial acetic acid causes severe gastric irritation similar to that caused by hydrochloric acid. (1)

Dilute acetic acid solutions containing up to 10% w/w of acetic acid have been used topically following jellyfish stings. (2) Dilute acetic acid solutions containing up to 5% w/w of acetic acid have also been applied topically to treat wounds and burns infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa . (3)

The lowest lethal oral dose of glacial acetic acid in humans is reported to be 1470 m g/kg. (4) The lowest lethal concentration on inhalation in humans is reported to be 816 ppm. (4) Humans, are, however, estimated to consume approximately 1 g/day of acetic acid from the diet.

LD50 (mouse, IV): 0.525 g/kg (4)

LD50 (rabbit, skin): 1.06 g/kg

LD50 (rat, oral): 3.31 g/kg

## 15 Handling Precautions

Observe normal precautions appropriate to the circumstances and quantity of material handled. Acetic acid, particularly glacial acetic acid, can cause burns on contact with the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Splashes should be washed with copious quantities of water. Protective clothing, gloves, and eye protection are recommended.

## 16 Regulatory Status

GRAS listed. Accepted as a food additive in Europe. Included in the FDA Inactive Ingredients Database (injections, nasal, ophthalmic,

and oral preparations). Included in parenteral and nonparenteral preparations licensed in the UK.

## 17 Related Substances

Acetic acid; artificial vinegar; dilute acetic acid.

## Acetic acid

## 11 Stability and Storage Conditions

Adipic acid is normally stable but decomposes above boiling point. It should be stored in a tightly closed container in a cool, dry place, and should be kept away from heat, sparks, and open flame.

## 12 Incompatibilities

Adipic acid is incompatible with strong oxidizing agents as well as strong bases and reducing agents. Contact with alcohols, glycols, aldehydes, epoxides, or other polymerizing compounds can result in violent reactions.

## 13 Method of Manufacture

Adipic acid is prepared by nitric acid oxidation of cyclohexanol or cyclohexanone or a mixture of the two compounds. Recently, oxidation of cyclohexene with 30% aqueous hydrogen peroxide under organic solventand halide-free conditions has been proposed as an environmentally friendly alternative for obtaining colorless crystalline adipic acid. (8)

## 14 Safety

Adipic acid is used in pharmaceutical formulations and food products. The pure form of adipic acid is toxic by the IP route, and moderately toxic by other routes. It is a severe eye irritant, and may cause occupational asthma.

## Applications in Pharmaceutical Formulation or Technology

Albumin is primarily used as an excipient in parenteral pharmaceutical formulations, where it is used as a stabilizing agent for formulations containing proteins and enzymes. (2) Albumin has also been used to prepare microspheres and microcapsules for experimental drug-delivery systems. (3-6)

As a stabilizing agent, albumin has been employed in protein formulations at concentrations as low as 0.003%, although concentrations of 1-5% are commonly used. Albumin has also been used as a cosolvent (7) for parenteral drugs, as a cryoprotectant during lyophilization, (8,9) and to prevent adsorption of other proteins to surfaces.

Therapeutically, albumin solutions have been used parenterally for plasma volume replacement and to treat severe acute albumin loss. However, the benefits of using albumin in such applications in critically ill patients has been questioned. (10)

## 8 Description

The USP 32 describes albumin human as a sterile nonpyrogenic preparation of serum albumin obtained from healthy human donors; see Section 13. It is available as a solution containing 4, 5, 20, or 25 g of serum albumin in 100 mL of solution, with not less than 96% of the total protein content as albumin. The solution contains no added antimicrobial preservative but may contain sodium acetyltryptophanate with or without sodium caprylate as a stablizing agent.

The PhEur 6.0 similarly describes albumin solution as an aqueous solution of protein obtained from human plasma; see Section 13. It is available as a concentrated solution containing 150-250g/L of total protein or as an isotonic solution containing 35-50g/L of total protein. Not less than 95% of the total protein content is albumin. A suitable stabilizer against the effects of heat, such as sodium caprylate (sodium octanoate) or Nacetyltryptophan or a combination of these two at a suitable concentration, may be added, but no antimicrobial preservative is added.

Aqueous albumin solutions are slightly viscous and range in color from almost colorless to amber depending upon the protein concentration. In the solid state, albumin appears as brownish amorphous lumps, scales, or powder.

## 10 Typical Properties

Acidity/alkalinity pH = 6.7-7.3 for a 1% w/v solution, in 0.9% w/v sodium chloride solution, at 20 C. 8

NIR spectra

see

Figure 1.

Osmolarity A 4-5% w/v aqueous solution is isoosmotic with serum.

Solubility Freely soluble in dilute salt solutions and water. Aqueous solutions containing 40% w/v albumin can be readily prepared at pH 7.4. The high net charge of the peptide contributes to its solubility in aqueous media. The seven disulfide bridges contribute to its chemical and spatial conformation. At physiological pH, albumin has a net electrostatic charge of about -17. Aqueous albumin solutions are slightly viscous and range in color from almost colorless to amber depending on the protein concentration.

## 11 Stability and Storage Conditions

Albumin is a protein and is therefore susceptible to chemical degradation and denaturation by exposure to extremes of pH, high salt concentrations, heat, enzymes, organic solvents, and other chemical agents.

Albumin solutions should be protected from light and stored at a temperature of 2-25 C or as indicated on the label. 8

## 12 Incompatibilities

See Section 11.

## 13 Method of Manufacture

Albumin human (USP 32) Albumin human is a sterile nonpyrogenic preparation of serum albumin that is obtained by fractionating material (source blood, plasma, serum, or placentas) from healthy human donors. The source material is tested for the absence of hepatitis B surface antigen. It is made by a process that yields a product safe for intravenous use.

Human albumin solution (PhEur 6.0) Human albumin solution is an aqueous solution of protein obtained from plasma. Separation of the albumin is carried out under controlled conditions so that the final product contains not less than 95% albumin. Human albumin solution is prepared as a concentrated solution containing 150-250g/L of total protein or as an isotonic solution containing 35-50g/L of total protein. A suitable stabilizer against the effects of heat such as sodium caprylate (sodium octanoate) or Nacetyltryptophan or a combination of these two at a suitable concentration, may be added, but no antimicrobial preservative is added at any stage during preparation. The solution is passed through a bacteriaretentive filter and distributed aseptically into sterile containers,

which are then closed so as to prevent contamination. The solution in its final container is heated to 60 /C6 1.0 C 8 and maintained at this temperature for not less than 10 hours. The containers are then incubated at 30-32 C for not less than 14 8 days or at 20-25 C for not less than 4 weeks and examined 8 visually for evidence of microbial contamination.

## 14 Safety

Albumin occurs naturally in the body, comprising about 60% of all the plasma proteins. As an excipient, albumin is used primarily in parenteral formulations and is generally regarded as an essentially nontoxic and nonirritant material. Adverse reactions to albumin infusion rarely occur but include nausea, vomiting, increased salivation, chills, and febrile reactions. Urticaria and skin rash have been reported. Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic shock, can occur. Albumin infusions are contraindicated in patients with severe anemia or cardiac failure. Albumin solutions with aluminum content of less than 200 m g/L should be used in dialysis patients and premature infants. (11)

## 10 Typical Properties

Antimicrobial activity Ethanol is bactericidal in aqueous mixtures at concentrations between 60% and 95% v/v; the optimum concentration is generally considered to be 70% v/v. Antimicrobial activity is enhanced in the presence of edetic acid or edetate salts. (1) Ethanol is inactivated in the presence of nonionic surfactants and is ineffective against bacterial spores.

Boiling point 78.15 C 8

Flammability Readily flammable, burning with a blue, smokeless flame.

Flash point 14 C (closed cup) 8

NIR spectra see Figures 1 and 2.

Solubility Miscible with chloroform, ether, glycerin, and water (with rise of temperature and contraction of volume).

Specific gravity 0.8119-0.8139 at 20 C 8

Note The above typical properties are for alcohol (ethanol 95% or 96% v/v). See Section 17 for typical properties of dehydrated alcohol.

## 11 Stability and Storage Conditions

Aqueous ethanol solutions may be sterilized by autoclaving or by filtration and should be stored in airtight containers, in a cool place.

## 12 Incompatibilities

In acidic conditions, ethanol solutions may react vigorously with oxidizing materials. Mixtures with alkali may darken in color owing to a reaction with residual amounts of aldehyde. Organic

salts or acacia may be precipitated from aqueous solutions or dispersions. Ethanol solutions are also incompatible with aluminum containers and may interact with some drugs.

## 13 Method of Manufacture

Ethanol is manufactured by the controlled enzymatic fermentation of starch, sugar, or other carbohydrates. A fermented liquid is produced containing about 15% ethanol; ethanol 95% v/v is then obtained by fractional distillation. Ethanol may also be prepared by a number of synthetic methods.

## 14 Safety

Ethanol and aqueous ethanol solutions are widely used in a variety of pharmaceutical formulations and cosmetics. It is also consumed in alcoholic beverages.

Ethanol is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and the vapor may be absorbed through the lungs; it is metabolized, mainly in the liver, to acetaldehyde, which is further oxidized to acetate.

Ethanol is a central nervous system depressant and ingestion of low to moderate quantities can lead to symptoms of intoxication including muscle incoordination, visual impairment, slurred speech, etc. Ingestion of higher concentrations may cause depression of medullary action, lethargy, amnesia, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, stupor, coma, respiratory depression, and cardiovascular collapse. The lethal human blood-alcohol concentration is generally estimated to be 400-500 mg/100 mL.

Although symptoms of ethanol intoxication are usually encountered following deliberate consumption of ethanol-containing beverages, many pharmaceutical products contain ethanol as a solvent, which, if ingested in sufficiently large quantities, may cause adverse symptoms of intoxication. In the USA, the maximum quantity of alcohol included in OTC medicines is 10% v/v for products labeled for use by people of 12 years of age and older, 5% v/v for products intended for use by children aged 6-12 years of age, and 0.5% v/v for products for use by children under 6 years of age. (14)

Parenteral products containing up to 50% of alcohol (ethanol 95 or 96% v/v) have been formulated. However, such concentrations can produce pain on intramuscular injection and lower concentrations such as 5-10% v/v are preferred. Subcutaneous injection of alcohol (ethanol 95% v/v) similarly causes considerable pain followed by anesthesia. If injections are made close to nerves, neuritis and nerve degeneration may occur. This effect is used therapeutically to cause anesthesia in cases of severe pain, although the practice of using alcohol in nerve blocks is controversial. Doses of 1 mL of absolute alcohol have been used for this purpose. (15)

Preparations containing more than 50% v/v alcohol may cause skin irritation when applied topically.

## 15 Handling Precautions

Observe normal precautions appropriate to the circumstances and quantity of material handled. Ethanol and aqueous ethanol solutions should be handled in a well-ventilated environment. In the UK, the long-term 8-hour TWA workplace exposure limit for ethanol is 1920 mg/m 3 (1000ppm). (17) Ethanol may be irritant to the eyes and mucous membranes, and eye protection and gloves are recommended. Ethanol is flammable and should be heated with care. Fixed storage tanks should be electrically grounded to avoid ignition from electrostatic discharges when ethanol is transferred.

Solubility Soluble in alkali hydroxides, producing viscous solutions; very slightly soluble or practically insoluble in ethanol (95%) and other organic solvents. Alginic acid swells in water but does not dissolve; it is capable of absorbing 200-300 times its own weight of water.

Viscosity (dynamic) Various grades of alginic acid are commercially available that vary in their molecular weight and hence viscosity. Viscosity increases considerably with increasing concentration; typically a 0.5% w/w aqueous dispersion will have a viscosity of approximately 20 mPa s, while a 2.0% w/w aqueous dispersion will have a viscosity of approximately 2000 mPa s. The viscosity of dispersions decreases with increasing temperature. As a general rule, a 1 C increase in temperature results in a 8 2.5% reduction in viscosity. At low concentrations, the viscosity of an alginic acid dispersion may be increased by the addition of a calcium salt, such as calcium citrate. See also Sections 11 and 18.

## 11 Stability and Storage Conditions

Alginic acid hydrolyzes slowly at warm temperatures producing a material with a lower molecular weight and lower dispersion viscosity.

Figure 1: Near-infrared spectrum of alginic acid measured by reflectance.

<!-- image -->

Alginic acid dispersions are susceptible to microbial spoilage on storage, which may result in some depolymerization and hence a decrease in viscosity. Dispersions should therefore be preserved with an antimicrobial preservative such as benzoic acid; potassium sorbate; sodium benzoate; sorbic acid; or paraben. Concentrations of 0.1-0.2% are usually used.

Alginic acid dispersions may be sterilized by autoclaving or filtration through a 0.22 m m filter. Autoclaving may result in a decrease in viscosity which can vary depending upon the nature of any other substances present. (7)

Alginic acid should be stored in a well-closed container in a cool, dry place.

## 12 Incompatibilities

Incompatible with strong oxidizing agents; alginic acid forms insoluble salts in the presence of alkaline earth metals and group III metals with the exception of magnesium.

## 13 Method of Manufacture

Alginic acid is a hydrophilic colloid carbohydrate that occurs naturally in the cell walls and intercellular spaces of various species of brown seaweed (Phaeophyceae). The seaweed occurs widely throughout the world and is harvested, crushed, and treated with dilute alkali to extract the alginic acid.

## 14 Safety

Alginic acid is widely used in food products and topical and oral pharmaceutical formulations. It is generally regarded as a nontoxic and nonirritant material, although excessive oral consumption may be harmful. Inhalation of alginate dust may be an irritant and has been associated with industrially related asthma in workers involved in alginate production. However, it appears that the cases of asthma were linked to exposure to unprocessed seaweed dust rather than pure alginate dust. (8) An acceptable daily intake of alginic acid and its ammonium, calcium, potassium, and sodium salts was not set by the WHO because the quantities used, and the background levels in food, did not represent a hazard to health. (9)

LD50 (rat, IP): 1.6 g/kg (10)

## 15 Handling Precautions

Observe normal precautions appropriate to the circumstances and quantity of material handled. Alginic acid may be irritant to the eyes or respiratory system if inhaled as dust; see Section 14. Eye protection, gloves, and a dust respirator are recommended. Alginic acid should be handled in a well-ventilated environment.

## 18 Comments

Alginic acid has been investigated for use in an ocular formulation of carteolol. (11)

In the area of controlled release, the preparation of indomethacin sustained-release microparticles from alginic acid (alginate)-gelatin hydrocolloid coacervate systems has been investigated. (12) In addition, as controlled-release systems for liposome-associated macromolecules, microspheres have been produced encapsulating

liposomes coated with alginic acid and poly-L-lysine membranes. (13) Alginate gel beads capable of floating in the gastric cavity have been prepared, the release properties of which were reported to be applicable for sustained release of drugs, and for targeting the gastric mucosa. (14)

Mechanical properties, water uptake, and permeability properties of a sodium salt of alginic acid have been characterized for controlled-release applications. (6) In addition, sodium alginate has been incorporated into an ophthalmic drug delivery system for pilocarpine nitrate. (15) Sodium alginate has been used to improve pelletization due to polyelectrolyte complex formation between cationic polymers such as chitosan. (16) Alginic acid has also been shown to be beneficial in the development of alginate gelencapsulated, chitosan-coated nanocores, where the alginates act as a protective agent for sensitive macromolecules such as proteins and peptides for prolonged release. (17) In addition, the crosslinking of dehydrated paracetamol sodium alginate pellets has been shown to successfully mask the drug's unpleasant taste by an extrusion/ spheronization technique. (18)

It has also been reported that associated chains of alginic acid complexed with cations can bind to cell surfaces and exert pharmacological effects, which depend on the cell type and the complexed cation. These complexes can be used to treat rheumatic disorders, diseases associated with atopic diathesis and liver diseases. (19)

An alginic oligosaccharide, obtained from a natural edible polysaccharide, has been shown to suppress Th2 responses and IgE production by inducing IL-12 production, and was found to be a useful approach for preventing allergic disorders. (20) Chemically modified alginic acid derivatives have also been researched for their anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antitumor activities. (21) Alginate/ antacid antireflux preparations have been reported to provide symptomatic relief by forming a physical barrier on top of the stomach contents in the form of a raft. (22)

Alginic acid dispersions are best prepared by pouring the alginic acid slowly and steadily into vigorously stirred water. Dispersions should be stirred for approximately 30 minutes. Premixing the alginic acid with another powder, such as sugar, or a water-miscible liquid such as ethanol (95%) or glycerin, aids dispersion.

When using alginic acid in tablet formulations, the alginic acid is best incorporated or blended using a dry granulation process.

Alginic acid gels for use in drug delivery systems may be prepared by adding D-glucono-D-lactone, which hydrolyzes in the presence of water to produce gluconic acid with a continuous lowering of pH. (23)

A specification for alginic acid is contained in the Food Chemicals Codex (FCC). (24)

The EINECS number for alginic acid is 232-680-1.

## Aliphatic Polyesters

## 1 Nonproprietary Names

None adopted.

## 2 Synonyms

See Table I.

## 3 Chemical Name and CAS Registry Number

See Table I.

## 4 Empirical Formula and Molecular Weight

Aliphatic polyesters are synthetic homopolymers or copolymers of lactic acid, glycolic acid, lactide, glycolide and e -hydroxycaproic acid. Typically, the molecular weights of homopolymers and copolymers range from 2000 to &gt; 100000Da.

## 5 Structural Formula

Poly(lactide-co-caprolactone)

<!-- image -->

## 6 Functional Category

Bioabsorbable material; biocompatible material; biodegradable material.

## 7 Applications in Pharmaceutical Formulation or Technology

Owing to their reputation as safe materials and their biodegradability, aliphatic polyesters are primarily used as biocompatible and biodegradable carriers in many types of implantable or injectable drug-delivery systems for both human and veterinary use. Examples of implantable drug delivery systems include rods, (1) cylinders, tubing, films, (2) fibers, pellets, and beads. (3) Examples of injectable drug-delivery systems include microcapsules, (4) microspheres, (5) nanoparticles, and liquid injectable controlled-release systems such as gel formulations. (6)

## 8 Description

Aliphatic polyesters are a group of synthesized homopolymers or copolymers. They are nontoxic and can easily be fabricated into a variety of novel devices, such as rods, screws, nails, and cylinders. The polymers are commercially available in varying molecular weights as both homopolymers and copolymers. Molecular weights of polyesters range from 2000 Da to greater than 100 000 Da.

Co-monomer ratios of lactic acid and glycolic acid (or lactide and glycolide) for poly(DL-lactideco -glycolide) range from 85 : 15 to 50 : 50. Table I shows the chemical and trade names of different commercially available aliphatic polyesters.

## 9 Pharmacopeial Specifications

## 10 Typical Properties

For typical physical and mechanical properties of the aliphatic polyesters, see Tables II, III, IV, V, VI, and VII.

Polymer composition and crystallinity play important roles in the solubility of these aliphatic polyesters. The crystalline homopolymers of glycolide or glycolic acid are soluble only in strong solvents, such as hexafluoroisopropanol. The crystalline homopolymers of lactide or lactic acid also do not have good solubility in most organic solvents. However, amorphous polymers of DL-lactide or DL-lactic acid and copolymers of lactide or lactic acid with a low glycolide or glycolic acid content are soluble in many organic solvents (Table II). Aliphatic polyesters are slightly soluble or insoluble in water, methanol, ethylene glycol, heptane, and hexane.

## 11 Stability and Storage Conditions

The aliphatic polyesters are easily susceptible to hydrolysis in the presence of moisture. Hence, they should be packaged under highpurity dry nitrogen and properly stored in airtight containers, preferably refrigerated at below 0 C. It is necessary to allow the 8 polymers to reach room temperature in a dry environment before opening the container. After the original package has been opened, it is recommended to re-purge the package with high-purity dry nitrogen prior to resealing.

## 12 Incompatibilities

-

## 13 Method of Manufacture

Generally, aliphatic polyesters can be synthesized via polycondensation of hydroxycarboxylic acids and catalytic ring-opening polymerization of lactones. Ring-opening polymerization is preferred because polyesters with high molecular weights can be

produced. Moreover, the dehydration of hydroxycarboxylic acids to form lactones does not have to be carried to a high degree of completion. Lactones can easily be purified owing to the differences of their physical and chemical properties from those of the corresponding hydroxycarboxylic acid. The esterification of the carboxylic acid end group makes polymers more hydrophobic, which decreases the hydrolytic degradation rate of the polymers in the presence of water or moisture.

## 14 Safety

Poly(lactic acide) or poly(lactide), poly(glycolic acid) or poly(glycolide), poly (lacticco -glycolic acid) or poly(lactideco -glycolide), and polycaprolactone are used in parenteral pharmaceutical formulations and are regarded as biodegradable, biocompatible, and bioabsorbable materials. Their biodegradation products are nontoxic, noncarcinogenic, and nonteratogenic. In general, these polyesters exhibit very little hazard.

## 15 Handling Precautions

Observe normal precautions appropriate to the circumstances and quantity of material handled. Contact with eyes, skin, and clothing, and breathing the dust of the polymers should be avoided. Aliphatic polyesters produce acid materials such as hydroxyacetic and/or lactic acid in the presence of moisture; thus, contact with materials that will react with acids, especially in moist conditions, should be avoided.

## 16 Regulatory Status

GRAS listed. Included in the Canadian List of Acceptable Nonmedicinal Ingredients. Poly(lactide) and poly(lactideco -glycolide) have been used in medical products and medical devices approved by the FDA.

## 17 Related Substances

Lactic acid.

## 18 Comments

Aliphatic polyesters are a group of synthesized, nontoxic, biodegradable polymers. In an aqueous environment, the polymer backbone undergoes hydrolytic degradation, through cleavage of the ester linkages, into nontoxic hydroxycarboxylic acids. Aliphatic polyesters are eventually metabolized to carbon dioxide and water, via the citric acid cycle.

The rate of biodegradation and drug-release characteristics from injectable drug-delivery systems formulated with the aliphatic polyesters can be controlled by changing the physicochemical properties of the polymers, such as crystallinity, hydrophobicity, monomer stereochemistry, copolymer ratio, end group, and

polymer molecular weight or by changing the porosity and geometry of the formulation.

Due to their ability to form complexes with heavy metal ions, aliphatic polyesters are added to skin-protective ointments. (7)

## 11 Stability and Storage Conditions

Alitame is stable in dry, room temperature conditions but undergoes degradation at elevated temperatures or when in solution at low pH. Alitame can degrade in a one-stage process to aspartic acid and alanine amide (under harsh conditions) or in a slow two-stage process by first degrading to its b -aspartic isomer and then to aspartic acid and alanine amide. At pH 5-8, alitame solutions at 23 C have a half-life of approximately 4 years. At pH 2 and 23 C 8 8 the half-life is 1 year.

Alitame should be stored in a well-closed container in a cool, dry place.

## 12 Incompatibilities

Alitame may be incompatible with oxidizing and reducing substances or strong acids and bases.

## 13 Method of Manufacture

Alitame may be synthesized by a number of routes. (2,3) For example, 3-(D-alaninamido)-2,2,4,4-tetramethylthietane is dissolved in water and L-aspartic acid N -thiocarboxyanhydride is then added in portions with vigorous stirring, maintaining the pH of 8.5-9.5. The pH is then adjusted to 5.5 and p -toluenesulfonic acid

monohydrate is added over a period of one hour. The precipitated crystalline p -toluenesulfonate salt is collected by filtration. To obtain alitame from its salt, a mixture of Amberlite LA-1 (liquid anion exchange resin), dichloromethane, deionized water, and the salt is stirred for one hour, resulting in two clear layers. The aqueous layer is treated with carbon, clarified by filtration, and cooled to crystallize alitame.

Alternatively, tetramethylthietane amine is condensed with an N -protected form of D-alanine to give alanyl amide. This is then coupled to a protected analogue of L-aspartic acid to give a crude form of alitame. The crude product is then purified.

## 14 Safety

Alitame is a relatively new intense sweetening agent used primarily in foods and confectionary. It is generally regarded as a relatively nontoxic and nonirritant material.

Chronic animal studies in mice, rats, and dogs carried out for a minimum of 18 months at concentrations &gt; 100mg/kg per day exhibited no toxic or carcinogenic effects. In people, no evidence of untoward effects were observed following ingestion of 15 mg/kg per day for two weeks.

Following oral administration 7-22% of alitame is unabsorbed and excreted in the feces. The remaining amount is hydrolyzed to aspartic acid and alanine amide. The aspartic acid is metabolized normally and the alanine amide excreted in the urine as a sulfoxide isomer, as the sulfone, or conjugated with glucuronic acid.

The WHO has set an acceptable daily intake of alitame at up to 0.1 mg/kg body-weight. (4)

LD50 (mouse, oral): &gt; 5g/kg

LD50 (rabbit, skin): &gt; 2g/kg

LD50 (rat, oral): &gt; 5g/kg

## 15 Handling Precautions

Observe normal precautions appropriate to the circumstances and quantity of material handled. Eye protection and gloves are recommended. Alitame should be stored in tightly closed containers, and protected from exposure to direct sunlight and higher than normal room temperatures.

## 4 Empirical Formula and Molecular Weight

Almond oil consists chiefly of glycerides of oleic acid, with smaller amounts of linoleic and palmitic acids. The PhEur 6.0 describes almond oil as the fatty oil obtained by cold expression from the ripe seeds of Prunus dulcis (Miller) DAWebb var. dulcis or Prunus dulcis (Miller) DA Webb var. amara (DC) Buchheim or a mixture of both varieties. A suitable antioxidant may be added.

The USP32-NF27 describes almond oil as the fixed oil obtained by expression from the kernels of varieties of Prunus dulcis (Miller) D.A. Webb (formerly known as Prunus amygdalus Batsch) (Fam. Rosaceae) except for Prunus dolcii (Miller) D.A. Webb var. amara (De (Andolle) Focke).

## 7 Applications in Pharmaceutical Formulation or Technology

Alpha tocopherol is primarily recognized as a source of vitamin E, and the commercially available materials and specifications reflect this purpose. While alpha tocopherol also exhibits antioxidant properties, the beta, delta, and gamma tocopherols are considered to be more effective as antioxidants.

Alpha-tocopherol is a highly lipophilic compound, and is an excellent solvent for many poorly soluble drugs. (1-4) Of widespread regulatory acceptability, tocopherols are of value in oil- or fat-based pharmaceutical products and are normally used in the concentration range 0.001-0.05% v/v. There is frequently an optimum concentration; thus the autoxidation of linoleic acid and methyl linolenate is reduced at low concentrations of alpha tocopherol, and is accelerated by higher concentrations. Antioxidant effectiveness can be increased by the addition of oil-soluble synergists such as lecithin and ascorbyl palmitate. (4)

Alpha tocopherol may be used as an efficient plasticizer. (5) It has been used in the development of deformable liposomes as topical formulations. (6)

d -Alpha-tocopherol has also been used as a non-ionic surfactant in oral and injectable formulations. (3)

## 8 Description

Alpha tocopherol is a natural product. The PhEur 6.0 describes alpha-tocopherol as a clear, colorless or yellowish-brown, viscous, oily liquid. See also Section 17.

A

Note that the USP 32 describes vitamin E as comprising d - or dl -alpha tocopherol, d -or dl -alpha tocopheryl acetate, or d -or dl -alpha tocopheryl acid succinate. However, the PhEur 6.0 describes alpha tocopherol and alpha tocopheryl acetate in separate monographs.

The diversity of the tocopherols described in the various pharmacopeial monographs makes the comparison of specifications more complicated; see Section 17.

## 10 Typical Properties

Boiling point 235 C 8

Density 0.947-0.951 g/cm 3

Flash point

240 C 8

Ignition point

340 C 8

Refractive index n D 20 = 1.503-1.507

Solubility Practically insoluble in water; freely soluble in acetone, ethanol, ether, and vegetable oils.

## 11 Stability and Storage Conditions

Tocopherols are oxidized slowly by atmospheric oxygen and rapidly by ferric and silver salts. Oxidation products include tocopheroxide, tocopherylquinone, and tocopherylhydroquinone, as well as dimers and trimers. Tocopherol esters are more stable to oxidation than the free tocopherols but are in consequence less effective antioxidants. See also Section 17.

Tocopherols should be stored under an inert gas, in an airtight container in a cool, dry place and protected from light.

## 12 Incompatibilities

Tocopherols are incompatible with peroxides and metal ions, especially iron, copper, and silver. Tocopherols may be absorbed into plastic. (7)

## 13 Method of Manufacture

Naturally occurring tocopherols are obtained by the extraction or molecular distillation of steam distillates of vegetable oils; for example, alpha tocopherol occurs in concentrations of 0.1-0.3% in corn, rapeseed, soybean, sunflower, and wheat germ oils. (8) Beta and gamma tocopherol are usually found in natural sources along with alpha tocopherol. Racemic synthetic tocopherols may be prepared by the condensation of the appropriate methylated hydroquinone with racemic isophytol. (9)

## 14 Safety

Tocopherols (vitamin E) occur in many food substances that are consumed as part of the normal diet. The daily nutritional requirement has not been clearly defined but is estimated to be 3.0-20.0 mg. Absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is dependent upon normal pancreatic function and the presence of bile. Tocopherols are widely distributed throughout the body, with some ingested tocopherol metabolized in the liver; excretion of metabolites is via the urine or bile. Individuals with vitamin E deficiency are usually treated by oral administration of tocopherols, although intramuscular and intravenous administration may sometimes be used.

Tocopherols are well tolerated, although excessive oral intake may cause headache, fatigue, weakness, digestive disturbance, and nausea. Prolonged and intensive skin contact may lead to erythema and contact dermatitis.

The use of tocopherols as antioxidants in pharmaceuticals and food products is unlikely to pose any hazard to human health since the daily intake from such uses is small compared with the intake of naturally occurring tocopherols in the diet.

The WHO has set an acceptable daily intake of tocopherol used as an antioxidant at 0.15-2.0 mg/kg body-weight. (10)

## 15 Handling Precautions

Observe normal precautions appropriate to the circumstances and quantity of material handled. Gloves and eye protection are recommended.

## 16 Regulatory Status

GRAS listed. Accepted in Europe as a food additive. Included in the FDA Inactive Ingredients Database (IV injections, powder, lyophilized powder for liposomal suspension; oral capsules, tablets, and topical preparations).

## 4 Empirical Formula and Molecular Weight

AlO(OH) 59.99

## 5 Structural Formula

Structural hydroxyl groups form hydrogen bonds between AlO(OH) octahedral sheets, where hydroxyl groups are exposed at the surface. The surface hydroxyl groups produce a pHdependent surface charge by accepting a proton to produce a positive site, or donating a proton to produce a negative site. The pH-dependent surface charge is characterized by the point of zero charge, which is equivalent to the isoelectric point in protein chemistry. The surface hydroxyl groups may also undergo ligand exchange with fluoride, phosphate, carbonate, sulfate, or borate anions.

## 6 Functional Category

Adsorbent; vaccine adjuvant.

## Aluminum Phosphate Adjuvant

## 1 Nonproprietary Names

None adopted.

## 2 Synonyms

Adju-Phos ; aluminum hydroxyphosphate; aluminium hydroxyphosphate; Rehydraphos .

## 3 Chemical Name and CAS Registry Number

Aluminum phosphate [7784-30-7]

## 4 Empirical Formula and Molecular Weight

Al(OH) (PO4) x y

The molecular weight is dependent on the degree of substitution of phosphate groups for hydroxyl groups.

## 5 Structural Formula

Aluminum phosphate adjuvant occurs as a precipitate of amorphous aluminum hydroxide in which some sites contain phosphate groups instead of hydroxyl. Both hydroxyl and phosphate groups are exposed at the surface. The hydroxyl groups produce a pHdependent surface charge by accepting a proton to produce a positive site, or donating a proton to produce a negative site. The pH-dependent surface charge is characterized by the point of zero charge, which is equivalent to the isoelectric point in protein chemistry. The surface hydroxyl groups may also undergo ligand exchange with fluoride, phosphate, carbonate, sulfate, or borate anions.

Aluminum phosphate adjuvant is not a stoichiometric compound. Rather, the degree of phosphate group substitution for hydroxyl groups depends on the precipitation recipe and conditions.

## 6 Functional Category

Adsorbent; vaccine adjuvant.

## 7 Applications in Pharmaceutical Formulation or Technology

Aluminum phosphate adjuvant is used in parenteral human and veterinary vaccines. (1) It activates Th2 immune responses, including IgG and IgE antibody responses.

## 8 Description

Aluminum phosphate adjuvant is a white hydrogel that sediments slowly and forms a clear supernatant.

## 9 Pharmacopeial Specifications

-

## 10 Typical Properties

Acidity/alkalinity pH = 6.0-8.0

Al : P atomic ratio 1.0-1.4 : 1.0

Aluminum (%)

0.5-0.75

Particle size distribution Primary particles are platy with an average diameter of 50nm. The primary particles form aggregates of 1-10 m m.

Point of zero charge pH = 4.6-5.6, depending on the Al : P atomic ratio.

Protein binding capacity &gt; 0.6 mg lysozyme/mg equivalent Al2O3 Solubility Soluble in mineral acids and alkali hydroxides. X-ray diffractogram Amorphous to x-rays.

## 11 Stability and Storage Conditions

Aluminum phosphate adjuvant is stable for at least 2 years when stored at 4-30 C in well-sealed 8 inert containers. It must not be

allowed to freeze as the hydrated colloid structure will be irreversibly damaged.

## 12 Incompatibilities

The point of zero charge is related directly to the Al : P atomic ratio. Therefore, the substitution of additional phosphate groups for hydroxyl groups will lower the point of zero charge. Substitution of carbonate, sulfate, or borate ions for hydroxyl groups will also lower the point of zero charge.

## 13 Method of Manufacture

Aluminum phosphate adjuvant is formed by the reaction of a solution of aluminum chloride and phosphoric acid with alkali hydroxide.

## 14 Safety

Aluminum phosphate adjuvant is intended for use in parenteral vaccines and is generally regarded as safe. It may cause mild irritation, dryness, and dermatitis on skin contact. It may also cause redness, conjunctivitis, and short-term mild irritation on eye contact. Ingestion of large amounts of aluminum phosphate adjuvant may cause respiratory irritation with nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Inhalation is unlikely, although the dried product may cause respiratory irritation and cough. Type I hypersensitivity reactions following parenteral administration have also been reported. (2)

## 15 Handling Precautions

Observe normal precautions appropriate to the circumstances and quantity of material handled. Eye protection and gloves are recommended.

## 16 Regulatory Status

GRAS listed. Accepted for use in human and veterinary vaccines in Europe and the USA. The limits for use in human vaccines are 0.85 mg aluminum/dose (FDA) and 1.25 mg aluminum/dose (WHO). There are no established limits for use in veterinary vaccines. Reported in the EPA TSCA Inventory.

## 10 Typical Properties

Solubility Miscible with ethanol (95%) and water. Specific gravity 0.892-0.910

## 11 Stability and Storage Conditions

On exposure to the air, ammonia solution rapidly loses ammonia. Ammonia solution should be stored in a well-closed container, protected from the air, in a cool, dry place. The storage temperature should not exceed 20 C. 8

## 12 Incompatibilities

Ammonia solution reacts vigorously with sulfuric acid or other strong mineral acids and the reaction generates considerable heat; the mixture boils.

## 13 Method of Manufacture

Ammonia is obtained commercially chiefly by synthesis from its constituent elements, nitrogen and hydrogen, which are combined under high pressure and temperature in the presence of a catalyst. Ammonia solution is produced by dissolving ammonia gas in water.

## 14 Safety

Ingestion of strong solutions of ammonia is very harmful and causes severe pain in the mouth, throat, and gastrointestinal tract as well as severe local edema with cough, vomiting, and shock. Burns to the esophagus and stomach may result in perforation. Inhalation of the

vapor causes sneezing, coughing, and, in high concentration, pulmonary edema. Asphyxia has been reported. The vapor is irritant to the eyes. Strong solutions are harmful when applied to the conjunctiva and mucous membranes. Topical application of even dilute ammonia solutions, used to treat insect bites, has caused burns, particularly when used with a subsequent dressing. (2-4)

When used as an excipient, ammonia solution is generally present in a formulation in a highly diluted form.

## 15 Handling Precautions

Observe normal precautions appropriate to the circumstances and quantity of material handled. Care should be used in handling strong or concentrated ammonia solutions because of the caustic nature of the solution and the irritating properties of its vapor. Before containers are opened, they should be well cooled. The closure should be covered with a cloth or similar material while opening. Ammonia solution should not be tasted and inhalation of the vapor should be avoided. Ammonia solution should be handled in a fume cupboard. Eye protection, gloves, and a respirator are recommended.

## 16 Regulatory Status

## 11 Stability and Storage Conditions

In powder form, ascorbic acid is relatively stable in air. In the absence of oxygen and other oxidizing agents it is also heat stable. Ascorbic acid is unstable in solution, especially alkaline solution, readily undergoing oxidation on exposure to the air. (2,3) The oxidation process is accelerated by light and heat and is catalyzed by traces of copper and iron. Ascorbic acid solutions exhibit maximum stability at about pH 5.4. Solutions may be sterilized by filtration.

The bulk material should be stored in a well-closed nonmetallic container, protected from light, in a cool, dry place.

## 12 Incompatibilities

Incompatible with alkalis, heavy metal ions, especially copper and iron, oxidizing materials, methenamine, phenylephrine hydrochloride, pyrilamine maleate, salicylamide, sodium nitrite, sodium salicylate, theobromine salicylate, and picotamide. (4,5) Additionally, ascorbic acid has been found to interfere with certain colorimetric assays by reducing the intensity of the color produced. (6)

## 13 Method of Manufacture

Ascorbic acid is prepared synthetically or extracted from various vegetable sources in which it occurs naturally, such as rose hips, blackcurrants, the juice of citrus fruits, and the ripe fruit of Capsicum annuum L. A common synthetic procedure involves the hydrogenation of D-glucose to D-sorbitol, followed by oxidation using Acetobacter suboxydans to form L-sorbose. A carboxyl group is then added at C1 by air oxidation of the diacetone derivative of Lsorbose and the resulting diacetone-2-keto-L-gulonic acid is converted to L-ascorbic acid by heating with hydrochloric acid.

## 14 Safety

Ascorbic acid is an essential part of the human diet, with 40 mg being the recommended daily dose in the UK (7) and 60mg in the USA. (8) However, these figures are controversial, with some advocating doses of 150 or 250 mg daily. Megadoses of 10 g daily have also been suggested to prevent illness although such large doses are now generally considered to be potentially harmful. (9-11)

The body can absorb about 500 mg of ascorbic acid daily with any excess immediately excreted by the kidneys. Large doses may cause diarrhea or other gastrointestinal disturbances. Damage to the teeth has also been reported. (12) However, no adverse effects have been reported at the levels employed as an antioxidant in foods, beverages, (13) and pharmaceuticals. The WHO has set an

acceptable daily intake of ascorbic acid, potassium ascorbate, and sodium ascorbate, as antioxidants in food, at up to 15 mg/kg bodyweight in addition to that naturally present in food. (14)

LD50 (mouse, IV): 0.52 g/kg (15)

LD50 (mouse, oral): 3.37 g/kg

LD50 (rat, oral): 11.9 g/kg

## 15 Handling Precautions

Ascorbic acid may be harmful if ingested in large quantities and may be irritating to the eyes. Observe normal precautions appropriate to the circumstances and quantity of material handled. Eye protection and rubber or plastic gloves are recommended.

## 16 Regulatory Status

GRAS listed. Accepted for use as a food additive in Europe. Included in the FDA Inactive Ingredients Database (inhalations, injections, oral capsules, suspensions, tablets, topical preparations, and suppositories). Included in medicines licensed in the UK. Included in the Canadian List of Acceptable Non-medicinal Ingredients.

## 17 Related Substances

Ascorbyl palmitate; erythorbic acid; sodium ascorbate.

## 18 Comments

Many dosage forms for ascorbic acid have been developed for its administration to patients, including microencapsulation. (16)

- A specification for ascorbic acid is contained in the Food Chemicals Codex (FCC). (17)

The EINECS number for ascorbic acid is 200-066-2. The PubChem Compound ID (CID) for ascorbic acid is 5785.

## 7 Applications in Pharmaceutical Formulation or Technology

Ascorbyl palmitate is primarily used either alone or in combination with alpha tocopherol as a stabilizer for oils in oral pharmaceutical formulations and food products; generally 0.05% w/v is used. It may also be used in oral and topical preparations as an antioxidant for drugs unstable to oxygen. The combination of ascorbyl palmitate with alpha tocopherol shows marked synergism, which increases the effect of the components and allows the amount used to be reduced.

The solubility of ascorbyl palmitate in alcohol permits it to be used in nonaqueous and aqueous systems and emulsions.

## 11 Stability and Storage Conditions

Ascorbyl palmitate is stable in the dry state, but is gradually oxidized and becomes discolored when exposed to light and high humidity. In an unopened container, stored in a cool place, it has a shelf life of at least 12 months. During processing, temperatures greater than 65 C should be avoided. 8

The bulk material should be stored in an airtight container at 8-15 C, protected from light. 8

## 12 Incompatibilities

Incompatibilities are known with oxidizing agents; e.g. in solution oxidation is catalyzed by trace metal ions such as Cu 2 þ and Fe 3 þ .

## 13 Method of Manufacture

Ascorbyl palmitate is prepared synthetically by the reaction of ascorbic acid with sulfuric acid followed by reesterification with palmitic acid.

## 14 Safety

Ascorbyl palmitate is used in oral pharmaceutical formulations and food products, and is generally regarded as an essentially nontoxic and nonirritant material. The WHO has set an estimated acceptable daily intake for ascorbyl palmitate at up to 1.25 mg/kg bodyweight. (2)

LD50 (mouse, oral): 25 g/kg (3)

LD50 (rat, oral): 10 g/kg

## 15 Handling Precautions

Observe normal precautions appropriate to the circumstances and quantity of material handled. Ascorbyl palmitate dust may cause irritation to the eyes and respiratory tract. Eye protection is recommended.

## 16 Regulatory Status

GRAS listed. Accepted for use as a food additive in Europe. Included in the FDA Inactive Ingredients Database (oral, rectal, topical preparations). Included in nonparenteral medicines licensed in the UK.

## 17 Related Substances

Ascorbic acid; sodium ascorbate.

## 18 Comments

In order to maximize the stability and efficacy of ascorbyl palmitate the following precautions are recommended: stainless steel, enamel, or glass should be used; deaeration (vacuum) procedures and inert gas treatment are recommended where feasible; protect from light and radiant energy.

The formation of ascorbyl palmitate vesicles (Aspasomes) and their pharmaceutical applications has been investigated. (4)

Sweetening agent.

## 7 Applications in Pharmaceutical Formulation or Technology

Aspartame is used as an intense sweetening agent in beverage products, food products, and table-top sweeteners, and in pharmaceutical preparations including tablets, (1,2) powder mixes, and vitamin preparations. It enhances flavor systems and can be used to mask some unpleasant taste characteristics; the approximate sweetening power is 180-200 times that of sucrose.

Unlike some other intense sweeteners, aspartame is metabolized in the body and consequently has some nutritive value: 1 g provides approximately 17kJ (4 kcal). However, in practice, the small quantity of aspartame consumed provides a minimal nutritive effect.

## 8 Description

Aspartame occurs as an off white, almost odorless crystalline powder with an intensely sweet taste.

## 11 Stability and Storage Conditions

Aspartame is stable in dry conditions. In the presence of moisture, hydrolysis occurs to form the degradation products L -aspartyl-Lphenylalanine and 3-benzyl-6-carboxymethyl-2,5-diketopiperazine with a resulting loss of sweetness. A third-degradation product is also known, b -L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester. For the stability profile at 25 C in aqueous buffers, 8 see Figure 2.

Stability in aqueous solutions has been enhanced by the addition of cyclodextrins, (4,5) and by the addition of polyethylene glycol 400 at pH 2. (6) However, at pH 3.5-4.5 stability is not enhanced by the replacement of water with organic solvents. (7)

Aspartame degradation also occurs during prolonged heat treatment; losses of aspartame may be minimized by using processes

that employ high temperatures for a short time followed by rapid cooling.

The bulk material should be stored in a well-closed container, in a cool, dry place.

## 12 Incompatibilities

Differential scanning calorimetry experiments with some directly compressible tablet excipients suggests that aspartame is incompatible with dibasic calcium phosphate and also with the lubricant magnesium stearate. (9) Reactions between aspartame and sugar alcohols are also known.

## 13 Method of Manufacture

Aspartame is produced by coupling together L-phenylalanine (or Lphenylalanine methyl ester) and L-aspartic acid, either chemically or enzymatically. The former procedure yields both the sweet a -aspartame and nonsweet b -aspartame from which the a -aspartame has to be separated and purified. The enzymatic process yields only a -aspartame.

## 14 Safety

Aspartame is widely used in oral pharmaceutical formulations, beverages, and food products as an intense sweetener, and is generally regarded as a nontoxic material. However, the use of aspartame has been of some concern owing to the formation of the potentially toxic metabolites methanol, aspartic acid, and phenylalanine. Of these materials, only phenylalanine is produced in sufficient quantities, at normal aspartame intake levels, to cause concern. In the normal healthy individual any phenylalanine produced is harmless; however, it is recommended that aspartame be avoided or its intake restricted by those persons with phenylketonuria. (10)

The WHO has set an acceptable daily intake for aspartame at up to 40mg/kg body-weight. (11) Additionally, the acceptable daily intake of diketopiperazine (an impurity found in aspartame) has been set by the WHO at up to 7.5 mg/kg body-weight. (12)

A number of adverse effects have been reported following the consumption of aspartame, (10,12) particularly in individuals who drink large quantities (up to 8 liters per day in one case) of aspartame-sweetened beverages. Reported adverse effects include: headaches; (13) grand mal seizure; (14) memory loss; (15) gastrointestinal symptoms; and dermatological symptoms. However, scientifically controlled peer-reviewed studies have consistently failed to produce evidence of a causal effect between aspartame consumption and adverse health events. (16,17) Controlled and thorough studies have confirmed aspartame s ' safety and found no credible link between consumption of aspartame at levels found in the human diet and conditions related to the nervous system and behavior, nor any other symptom or illness. Aspartame is well documented to be nongenotoxic and there is no credible evidence that aspartame is carcinogenic. (18)

Although aspartame has been reported to cause hyperactivity and behavioral problems in children, a double-blind controlled trial of 48 preschool-age children fed diets containing a daily intake of 38 /C6 13mg/kg body-weight of aspartame for 3 weeks showed no adverse effects attributable to aspartame, or dietary sucrose, on children's behavior or cognitive function. (19)

## 15 Handling Precautions

Observe normal precautions appropriate to the circumstances and quantity of material handled. Measures should be taken to minimize the potential for dust explosion. Eye protection is recommended.

## 16 Regulatory Status

Accepted for use as a food additive in Europe and in the USA. Included in the FDA Inactive Ingredients Database (oral powder for reconstitution, buccal patch, granules, syrups, and tablets). Included in nonparenteral medicines licensed in the UK. Included in the Canadian List of Acceptable Non-medicinal Ingredients.

## 17 Related Substances

Alitame; aspartame acesulfame; neotame.

## Aspartame acesulfame

Empirical formula C18H23O9N3S Molecular weight 457.46

CAS number

106372-55-8

Comments A compound of aspartame and acesulfame approx. 350 times sweeter than sucrose. Aspartame acesulfame is listed in the USP32-NF27.

## 18 Comments

The intensity of sweeteners relative to sucrose depends upon their concentration, temperature of tasting, and pH, and on the flavor and texture of the product concerned.

Intense sweetening agents will not replace the bulk, textural, or preservative characteristics of sugar, if sugar is removed from a formulation.

Synergistic effects for combinations of sweeteners have been reported, e.g. aspartame with acesulfame potassium.

Aspartame can cause browning when used at high temperatures.

Aspecification for aspartame is contained in the Food Chemicals Codex (FCC). (20)

The PubChem Compound ID (CID) for aspartame includes 2242 and 21462246.
